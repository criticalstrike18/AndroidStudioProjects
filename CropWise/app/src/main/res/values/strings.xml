This improves soil health, water retention, and feeds beneficial microbes that release nutrients for your mothbeans. Vermicompost is another excellent option, use 1 ton per hectare for a good boost. Remember, a healthy soil equals healthy mothbeans!</string>
    <string name="coffeefertreq">Your coffee needs a steady supply of nutrients to thrive! Organic fertilizers, like compost made from coffee pulp and leaves, can provide these. Aim to replace what your harvest removes. For every ton of coffee beans, replenish around 13 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, and 15 kg of potassium. A soil test can help fine-tune the exact mix. Apply compost throughout the year, focusing on the root zone. Remember, healthy soil with plenty of organic matter feeds your coffee plants for long-term success.</string>
    <string name="ricefertreq">Your rice needs a healthy diet just like you! Organic fertilizers, like compost, manure, and leftover crop bits, feed the soil life which helps your rice thrive. They release nutrients slowly over time, improving soil health. Unlike chemical fertilizers, you\'ll likely need more organic matter to deliver the same amount of nutrients. Aim for 5-20 tons per hectare depending on the type of organic fertilizer. Remember, a soil test can help you determine the exact needs of your field.</string>
    <string name="chickpeafertreq">Chickpeas, being legumes, get most nitrogen (up to 75%) from Rhizobium bacteria in their roots. But for a healthy start, especially in drier soils, consider a small amount of organic nitrogen source like composted manure or neem cake before sowing. Focus on phosphorus for strong roots and good yields. Compost or bone meal are good organic options. A soil test can help determine if extra potassium or sulfur is needed, which can be added through organic sources like potash from straw or gypsum. Remember, healthy soil with plenty of organic matter is key for chickpea success!</string>
    <string name="cottonfertreq">For healthy cotton without chemicals, focus on organic fertilizers! Cotton needs a good balance of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). Aim for around 60 kg N, 30 kg P, and 15 kg K per hectare. To achieve this, use composted manure (4-5 tonnes/acre) before sowing. You can also use green manure crops like legumes, which enrich the soil with nitrogen as they decompose. Biofertilizers like Azotobacter and PSB can further boost nutrient availability. Remember, a healthy soil teeming with microbes is key for organic cotton success!</string>
    <string name="maizefertreq">For a healthy maize crop, aim for 4-5 tonnes of Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost per acre during land prep. This feeds the soil and nourishes your maize. You can also use vermicompost, a finer and richer option, at 3 tonnes per acre. Alongside this, consider biofertilizers like Azospirillum (1-2 kg/acre) to boost soil fertility, especially beneficial for rainfed crops that might need a little extra help. Remember, a healthy soil leads to a healthy and high-yielding maize harvest!</string>
    <string name="coconutfertreq">Your coconut palms thrive with organic goodness!

To give them a nutrient boost, consider dividing this into two applications, one in September and another in May.  Remember, healthy soil equals healthy palms!</string>
    <string name="blackgramfertreq">For a bountiful blackgram harvest, nourish your soil with organic goodness! Start by applying well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) at 2.5 tonnes per hectare before sowing. Composted coir pith or vermicompost can also be used at similar quantities. To boost nitrogen fixation, treat your seeds with Rhizobium culture. Remember, healthy soil feeds healthy plants! For micronutrient needs, consider seed coating with Zinc, Molybdenum, and Cobalt. Talk to your local agriculture department for specific recommendations based on your soil conditions.</string>
    <string name="jutefertreq">Jute thrives with organic goodness! Aim for 5-10 tonnes of Farmyard Manure (FYM) per hectare applied a month before sowing. This feeds the soil microbes and provides essential nutrients for strong jute growth. Remember, leftover crop stubble and roots from the previous harvest also add organic matter back into the soil, so consider minimal tillage. By promoting a healthy soil ecosystem, you\'ll be nurturing your jute crop naturally.</string>
    <string name="kidneybeansfertreq">Kidney beans, like most legumes, are nitrogen fixers! This means they pull nitrogen from the air and store it in nodules on their roots, enriching the soil. So, they usually won\'t need extra nitrogen fertilizer. But, if your leaves look pale early on, a light feeding of fish emulsion or composted manure tea can perk them up. Focus instead on building healthy soil with compost, aged manure, and neem cake for a good all-round boost.</string>
    <string name="pigeonpeasfertreq">Pigeonpeas benefit greatly from organic fertilizers! Compost, farmyard manure (FYM), and vermicompost are all excellent choices. Apply 10 tonnes per hectare for FYM or compost to boost your pigeonpea\'s health and yield. Remember, a soil test is key to fine-tuning nutrient needs.  While organic sources provide most nutrients, consider adding 20 kg/hectare of sulfur for an extra boost!</string>
    <string name="orangefertreq">Your orange trees thrive on organic goodness! Compost, aged manure (cow or goat), and neem cake are excellent choices. Apply in spring, keeping a distance from the trunk. Young trees need less, so start with a small amount and adjust based on growth. For full-grown oranges, consider 2-3 kg compost or manure, mixed with 500 gm neem cake, spread around the tree\'s drip line. Watch for leaf color - pale green indicates a nitrogen need, so add more neem cake. Remember, slow and steady wins the race with organic fertilizer!</string>
    <string name="pomegranatefertreq">our pomegranates love organic food! To keep them thriving, focus on building healthy soil. Use well-composted cow dung manure or vermicompost throughout the year. These are rich in nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, helping your trees grow strong and produce juicy fruits. Apply more compost as your trees mature, following a light and frequent approach rather than a heavy, one-time application. Remember, happy soil leads to happy pomegranates!</string>
    <string name="applefertreq">Your apple trees will love organic fertilizer! It feeds them naturally with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for healthy growth and fruiting. Compost, aged manure, and neem cake are all great options. Apply them in a ring around the base of the tree, keeping a distance from the trunk. Feed your trees in early spring before new growth, and again after fruit set for a nourishing boost. Remember, organic fertilizers release nutrients slower, so a little extra goes a long way!</string>
